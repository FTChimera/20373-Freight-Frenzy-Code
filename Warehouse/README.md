This folder consists of two types of programs: Warehouse and Combined Warehouse. Warehouse does the warehouse autonomous, and parks in the entrance closest to the alliance shipping hub. Combined Warehouse is the same as the warehouse programs, except it parks the robot in the entrance closest to the shares shipping hub.
