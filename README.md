# 20373-Freight-Frenzy-Code
Our code from the 2021-2022 Freight Frenzy FTC competition.

## Warehouse
This folder consists of two types of programs: Warehouse and Combined Warehouse. Warehouse does the warehouse autonomous, and parks in the entrance closest to the alliance shipping hub. Combined Warehouse is the same as the warehouse programs, except it parks the robot in the entrance closest to the shared shipping hub.

## Carousel [OUTDATED]
The Carousel code is the original Carousel autonomous period code. This code caused problems with the ducks falling on our robot, so it is outdated.

## Better-Carousel
Better Carousel is the second version of our Carousel Autonomous, after the original Carousel code caused ducks to fall on the robot.
